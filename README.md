What kind of additional data would you want to develop your solution? What features
would you expect to be predictive and reasonable to gather?

 1) more data from partners, for example the partner working field, their website time to loading and ...
 2) more data from leaders, their gender, the partner's field that they choose...
 3) Time-related data such as timestamps, seasonality, trends, and periodic patterns

What architecture / service would you prefer to use to deploy the solution to production?
Consider several alternatives.

 1) Google Cloud AI Platform
 2) AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
 3) Microservices Architecture with Container Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)
    
How would you validate that your solution works as expected in production? How would
  you monitor its performance and stability?
  Validating and monitoring a solution in production is possible with using of Implement A/B testing to compare 
  the performance of the new solution against a baseline or existing solution. Also, set up CI/CD pipelines to 
  automate the deployment process of new versions or updates to the solution. The other way is perform load 
  testing, stress testing, and performance profiling to evaluate the solution's scalability, reliability, and 
  responsiveness under different load conditions. More over, set up alerts for critical errors or exceptions 
  that may impact the solution's performance or stability.
  
What would be other important considerations to keep in mind when working on this
problem?
   Strive to develop models that are interpretable and explainable, especially if the decisions made by the 
   model have significant implications for leads or partners. This helps build trust and understanding of the 
   model's behavior.
   Also consider the cost implications of deploying and operating the solution, including infrastructure costs, 
   model training costs, and ongoing maintenance expenses. Strive to optimize cost-effectiveness while 
   maintaining performance and quality.
